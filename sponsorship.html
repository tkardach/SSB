        <p>Every year over 1,000 student athletes participate in one of Saratoga High School’s 24 sports teams such as football, soccer, basketball, volleyball, tennis, cross country, track, softball and baseball.  Your donations to the SHS Sports Boosters help to cultivate the next generation of student athletes and future leaders.  These donations allow us to ensure that athletes are kept safe with proper equipment, facilities and uniforms.  Contributions and donations from our corporate sponsors provide a vital community partnership with our athletic program.  We invite you to support our athletic program while also promoting your business to the hundreds of local families that participate in SHS’s athletic programs.</p>
